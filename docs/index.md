# DevOps and Developer Productivity

DevOps is a set of principles and practices that aims at shortening the time to market and improving the customer experience of a software product. The principles and practices are based on the following two foundational ideas.

* Firstly, that removing boundaries between traditional development and operations silos, and automating the entire software development and delivery process improves developer productivity. This allows teams to spend more time on developing features and less on process and organizational boundaries for releasing code.
* Secondly, that providing the toolsets to easily operate and manage products in production, automating the feedback loops and shortening the line of site between developer and customer allows developers to empathize more with customer and provide better customer experience.

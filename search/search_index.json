The principles and practices are based on the following two foundational ideas. Firstly, that removing boundaries between traditional development and operations silos, and automating the entire software development and delivery process improves developer productivity. This allows teams to spend more time on developing features and less on process and organizational boundaries for releasing code. Secondly, that providing the toolsets to easily operate and manage products in production, automating the feedback loops and shortening the line of site between developer and customer allows developers to empathize more with customer and provide better customer experience.

Continuous Integration focuses on enabling teams to continuously integrate changes to main line, test them multiple times a day, and recover quickly from failures with consistent feedback loop. Continuous Delivery focuses on enabling teams to automatically deliver specific versions of the product to different environments and go through a set of tests. Continuous Deployment focuses on enabling teams to go automatically from code commit to production using the continuous integration and continuous delivery solutions along with promotion criteria that defines the readiness of the change to be released through a set of stages and finally to production The main outcome of this practice is a CI/CD pipeline which continuously builds, deploys, tests, and promotes or drops changes through a set of stages before releasing it to production. A CI/CD pipeline highlighting Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment is given in the diagram below: Continuous Integration Continuous integration allows integration of code changes to the main line multiple times a day and allows for fast recovery by automatically building and testing these changes and providing constant and quick feedback to the committers. The outcome of Continuous Integration is a versioned deployable artifact that is stored in an artifact repository for consumption later by other services or for deployment. The main components of continuous integration are Continuous merges: Done using version control tools like Github, Perforce Automated builds : Done using standard build tools like Maven, Gradle, make, docker (for containers) Automated testing : Done using tools like junit Code Coverage calculation : Done using tools like JaCoCo and Cobertura Static Code Analysis : Done using tools like Checkstyle, Findbugs etc. Promotion Criteria, Change Monitoring, and Feedback Loop : Done using CI tools like Jenkins Artifact Storage: Done using tools like Nexus, Artifactory, Docker hub, PyPi etc. Continuous Delivery and Deployment Continuous delivery is a practice that allows repetitive deployment of different versions of the application/service to different environments in a consistent and fail-safe way for testing. The deployment includes install and configuration of the new version of the software to support different hardware and testing requirements. A continuous delivery pipeline automatically deploys product artifacts created by the build stage to various environments and runs automatic tests on the application. It also automatically uses the test results to validate promotion criteria and promote the build to the next environment. While promotion to preproduction environments is automatic, the promotion to production is manual. A continuous deployment pipeline will also look the same with the exception that promotion to production is automatic and not manual. Main components of Continuous Delivery and Deployment are: Deployment Automation : Done using tools like Puppet, Chef, Scripts, Kubectl, AMIs etc. Test Automation : Promotion Criteria, and Feedback Loop : Done using tools like Jenkins, Spinnaker etc. Pipelines and Branching Models","title":"CICD"},{"location":"product/cicd/#cicd","text":"CI/CD or Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and Deployment is a DevOps practice that aims at shortening time to market of new features and changes in a software product and improving developer productivity by automating the entire software release process from conception to delivery.
